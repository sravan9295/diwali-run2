# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a minimal, production-ready Three.js starter project tailored for Kiro workflows. The system will provide a clean development environment with Vite, TypeScript, strict linting/formatting, and mobile-friendly rendering capabilities.

## Glossary

- **Three.js Starter System**: The complete project structure and configuration files that provide a foundation for Three.js development
- **Vite Build System**: The build tool that provides fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds
- **Scene Management System**: The modular components that handle Three.js scene creation, camera setup, and renderer configuration
- **Render Loop System**: The animation loop that handles frame timing and object updates
- **Resize Handler System**: The responsive system that handles viewport changes and device orientation
- **Linting System**: The ESLint configuration that enforces code quality standards
- **Formatting System**: The Prettier configuration that maintains consistent code style
- **React Three Fiber System**: The React renderer for Three.js that enables declarative 3D scene creation using JSX components

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a minimal Three.js project structure, so that I can quickly start building 3D applications without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Three.js Starter System SHALL provide a clean directory structure with separate folders for scene components
2. THE Three.js Starter System SHALL include a package.json with essential dependencies and development scripts
3. THE Three.js Starter System SHALL use Three.js version 0.169.0 or compatible
4. THE Three.js Starter System SHALL include TypeScript configuration for type safety
5. THE Three.js Starter System SHALL provide a working example with a 3D object (TorusKnot) and lighting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast development workflow with HMR, so that I can see changes instantly during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Vite Build System SHALL provide Hot Module Replacement for instant updates during development
2. THE Vite Build System SHALL open the browser automatically when starting the development server
3. THE Vite Build System SHALL generate source maps for debugging in production builds
4. WHEN the development server starts, THE Vite Build System SHALL serve the application on a local port
5. THE Vite Build System SHALL support TypeScript compilation without additional configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular scene management, so that I can easily organize and maintain my 3D scene components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Scene Management System SHALL separate renderer creation into a dedicated module
2. THE Scene Management System SHALL separate scene setup into a dedicated module  
3. THE Scene Management System SHALL separate camera configuration into a dedicated module
4. THE Scene Management System SHALL provide a makeRenderer function that configures WebGL settings
5. THE Scene Management System SHALL provide a makeScene function that creates a basic 3D scene with lighting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mobile-friendly rendering, so that my 3D applications work well on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Render Loop System SHALL cap pixel ratio to maximum of 2 for performance optimization
2. THE Render Loop System SHALL clamp delta time to prevent animation spikes on slow frames
3. THE Resize Handler System SHALL use ResizeObserver to handle container size changes
4. THE Resize Handler System SHALL handle device orientation changes
5. WHEN the viewport changes, THE Resize Handler System SHALL update camera aspect ratio and renderer size

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want strict code quality tools, so that I can maintain consistent and error-free code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Linting System SHALL use ESLint with TypeScript support for code quality enforcement
2. THE Linting System SHALL provide recommended rules for TypeScript and general JavaScript
3. THE Formatting System SHALL use Prettier for consistent code formatting
4. THE Formatting System SHALL configure single quotes and no semicolons as default style
5. THE Three.js Starter System SHALL provide npm scripts for linting and formatting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper cleanup and resource management, so that I can avoid memory leaks during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Hot Module Replacement occurs, THE Render Loop System SHALL cancel the animation frame
2. WHEN Hot Module Replacement occurs, THE Resize Handler System SHALL disconnect observers and remove event listeners
3. WHEN Hot Module Replacement occurs, THE Scene Management System SHALL dispose of WebGL resources
4. THE Render Loop System SHALL use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
5. THE Three.js Starter System SHALL provide cleanup functions for all event listeners and observers

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a React developer, I want React Three Fiber integration, so that I can build 3D scenes using React components and hooks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Three.js Starter System SHALL include React Three Fiber as an optional development approach
2. THE React Three Fiber System SHALL provide @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei dependencies
3. THE React Three Fiber System SHALL include React 18 with TypeScript support
4. THE React Three Fiber System SHALL provide a Canvas component that wraps the Three.js renderer
5. THE React Three Fiber System SHALL demonstrate declarative 3D scene creation using JSX components
