# Implementation Plan

## Current Status

This Devvit project already has a substantial Three.js implementation in place. The following analysis shows what's complete vs. what needs to be done to meet the Three.js starter requirements:

- ESLint + Prettier configuration with proper rules
- Mobile-optimized rendering with pixel ratio handling
- Responsive canvas with resize handling
